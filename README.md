Features:

Create new tenants with relevant information (e.g., name, identifier, etc.).
Retrieve tenants by ID or other criteria.
Update existing tenant information.
Delete tenants (consider data integrity and associated resources).
Requirements:

Node.js and npm (or yarn)
A database system to store tenant data
Installation:

Clone this repository.
Install dependencies:
Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
Configuration:

Update the database connection details in the code (e.g., connection string, username, password).
Usage:

This API uses a standard RESTful API design with the following endpoints:

Base URL: http://localhost:<port>/ (replace <port> with the port your server is running on)

1. Create Tenant (POST):

POST /tenants

Request Body:

{
  "name": "string", (required)
  // ... other relevant tenant information (e.g., identifier, etc.)
}

Response:

{
  "id": number,
  "name": "string",
  // ... other tenant details returned
}
2. Get Tenant by ID (GET):

GET /tenants/:id

Response:

{
  "id": number,
  "name": "string",
  // ... other tenant details returned
}
3. Update Tenant (PATCH):

PATCH /tenants/:id

Request Body:

{
  "name": "string", (optional)
  // ... other tenant information to update
}

Response:

{
  "message": "Tenant updated successfully"
}
4. Delete Tenant (DELETE):

DELETE /tenants/:id

Response:

{
  "message": "Tenant deleted successfully"
}
Development:

Start the development server:
Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
This will start the server on port 3000 by default.

Testing:

Unit tests are recommended to ensure the functionality of the API. You can use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

Disclaimer:

This is a basic example and might require further customization based on your specific requirements.

Additional Considerations:

If your API allows associating agents, resources, or other data with tenants, you'll need to address data integrity during tenant deletion. Consider cascading deletes or providing options for data migration.
You might want to include functionalities for managing tenant permissions or access control mechanisms.
Security is crucial. Implement proper authentication and authorization for accessing tenant data.
